## Paper concept
0. abstract
1. introduction
   1. automata theory
   2. DFA
   3. passive learning (from samples)
   4. our problem
2. formal definitions
3. theory
   1. why we can only focus on missing edges (missing states are trvial)
   2. our problem is NP-complete
      1. NP-hard
      2. in NP
   3. FPT analysis
      1. our problem is W[1]-hard (k-clique reduction)
      2. our problem is W[2]-hard ()
      3. our problem is in W[P]
4. practice
    - list algorithms / optimization strategies and analyze them (possible drawbacks)
      - brute force
      - trie
      - jumps over known edges
      - backtrack
    - compare performance on different automata types
    - testing methods, stats, charts, comparisons etc
