## About triggers
**DML Triggers**: These triggers are fired when a DML (Data Manipulation Language) event occurs (INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). They are further classified into two types:  

**After Triggers (or FOR Triggers)**: These triggers fire after the triggering action occurs.   
* **Instead Of Triggers**: These triggers fire instead of the triggering action. They are primarily used with views.  
* **DDL Triggers**: These triggers are fired in response to DDL (Data Definition Language) events such as CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.  

**Logon Triggers**: These triggers are fired in response to a LOGON event, which is raised when a user sessions is being established.
