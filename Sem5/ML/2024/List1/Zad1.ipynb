    "# Problem 1: Finding the Optimal k and Bootstrap Iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The goal is to determine:\n",
    "1. The optimal number of neighbors (k) for the KNN classifier.\n",
    "2. The optimal number of bootstrap iterations needed to confidently estimate the modelâ€™s accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download and preprocess the MNIST dataset** (use 10% of the dataset for faster experimentation).\n",
    "2. **Implement bootstrap resampling** to evaluate the KNN classifier for various values of k.\n",
    "3. Experiment with **different numbers of bootstrap iterations**.\n",
    "4. **Determine the optimal values of k** and the minimum number of bootstrap iterations required for a confident result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Follow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocess the MNIST dataset**:\n",
    "   - Normalize the pixel values (e.g., divide by 255 to scale between 0 and 1).\n",
    "   - Select a random 10% subset of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **KNN Classifier**:\n",
    "   - Use the `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn.neighbors`.\n",
    "   - Iterate over different values of k, specifically $k = 1, 2, \\dots, 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bootstrap Resampling**:\n",
    "   - For each value of k, perform several bootstrap iterations:\n",
    "     - Resample the entire dataset with replacement to create a training set.\n",
    "     - Train the KNN model on the resampled data.\n",
    "     - Test the model on the remaining data points (out-of-bag data).\n",
    "     - Compute and store the accuracy on the out-of-bag data for each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Determine Optimal k and Bootstrap Iterations**:\n",
    "   - Experiment with different numbers of bootstrap iterations (e.g., try 1, 2, 11, 22, 44, 88, etc.).\n",
    "   - Calculate the mean accuracy across bootstrap iterations for each k.\n",
    "   - Determine the optimal k and the number of iterations required for a stable estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Plot**:\n",
    "   - Plot the mean accuracy for each value of k.\n",
    "   - Include another plot showing how the mean accuracy stabilizes with increasing bootstrap iterations.\n"
