    "\n",
    "Many natural language processing tasks requrie continuous representations for words.\n",
    "[Word embeddings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) are mappings from a discrete\n",
    "space to real-valued vectors. Word embeddings might be trained with neural networks,\n",
    "either as a by-product of other tasks (e.g., language modeling, neural machine translation),\n",
    "or with networks designed specifically for the word embedding task.\n",

    "output probability distribution over large vocabularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular architectures for training word embeddings is called Word2vec [[1]()], [[2]()]. It builds on the idea that semantics of a word can be defined through the contexts,\n",
    "in which the word appears in the sentence.\n",

    "Let $w_1, w_2,\\ldots,w_N$ be an $N$-word sentence in a natural language.\n",

    "    translates word embeddings between languages. It has been shown that such ortonormal mappings allow to express\n",
