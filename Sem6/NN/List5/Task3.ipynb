    "You have two corpora for these languages (with different sentences); see files [polish_lower](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H1WMHpf3UXe2Q_QrhuvbxPTbsinvHIHr/view?usp=drive_link), [polish_upper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H5117jA6VKiGEizqu15ap6eWkDdbE02t/view?usp=drive_link) . Your task is to train word embedings for both languages together, so as to make embeddings of the words which are its translations as close as possible. But unfortunately, you have the budget which allows you to prepare the translation only for 1000 words (we call it D, you have to deside which words you want to be in D)\n",
